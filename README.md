## Chinese Sentence Segmentation
Playing around with ways of emulating different chinese sentence techniques in the browser

## Why?
Everyone and their mom has done some sort of Chinese NLP thing, how is this different?

It's not, really.
But basically it's cause not everyone has a server in X or wants to use language Y (I'm looking at you, Java) etc. How can I create the most efficient single JS file that can compete with some of the large, expansive, OMFG I have 98,000 bigrams in my database.  What is a reasonable list of words that I need? These kinds of questions.

## Done
* Forward Maximum Matching
* Backward Maximum Matching

## Next up?
* Conditional Random Fields
* Finding a better bigram list... 

## Current word list
Bigrams up till HSK Level 6
